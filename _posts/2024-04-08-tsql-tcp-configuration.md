How to Configure TCP Network Configurations
=========================================== 

TCP is a very common means of accessing SQL Server. To set it up on a Windows machine we will need to cover: 
- SQL Server Configuration Manager
- services
- firewalls


## 1. SQL Server Configuration Manager 

Open SQL Server Configuration Manager > SQL Server Network Configuration > Protocols for MSSQLSERVER. 

Ensure the TCP/IP protocol is enabled. Click on it to access the properties. For each of the listed IT Addresses: 
- delete any setting for "TCP Dynamic Ports" so that it is blank 
- set "TCP Port" to 1433. 

## 2. Services 
Restart both the SQL Server engine and brower services. 

## 3. Firewall 

Add an inbound rule to Windows Firewall for port 1433 TCP/1P.

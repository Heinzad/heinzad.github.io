How to analyse and implement graphs in Python.  


# Overview

Graphs have:
* vertices (nodes)
* edges (links)

Edges may be directed. They may also be weighted. 

Searching may be done via:
* BFS - Breadth-first search 
* DFS - Depth-first search


Graphs are analysed in several ways: 
* Euler path - visits every edge once
* Euler circuit - visits every edge once to start and end at same vertex 
* Hamiltonian path - visits every vertex (Travelling Salesperson)
* MST - Minimum-Spanning Tree 
-- Prim's Algorithm 
-- Kruskal's Algorithm

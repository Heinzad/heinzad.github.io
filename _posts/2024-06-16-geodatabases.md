What is a Geodatabase? 
======================


Geodatabases are a term utilised by ArcGIS. They can usefully be contrasted with shapefiles and spatial databases. 

## Shapefiles 

Shapefiles are a longstanding open specification of data interoperability for vector data types. 

A shapefile may only contain one vector data type:  

- points
- lines
- polygons


### Files in a shapefile: 

The various files can be distinguished by their extensions: 
- shp - shape geometry 
- shx - shape index
- dbf - attributes (dBase format)
- prj - projection (crs wkt)

### Feature Layer: 

A Feature layer is a zipped shapefile collating all the files that make up the "shapefile" itself. 


## Spatial Database Servers

Spatial databases, such as Postgres with the PostGIS extension, provide their own spatial indexing and spatial functions (e.g. ST_Contains(), ST_Intersects(), etc.) 

## Geodatabases 

Geodatabases are ESRI-specific. They are either server- or file-based systems. They are managed using ArcGIS Catalog. 

### File-based geodatabases:

The file-based geodatabases can be distinguished by their extensions: 

- **mdb** - *Personal Geodatabase* - An MS Access RDBMS (deprecated)
- **geodatabase** - *Mobile Geodatabase* - An SQLite RDBMS. 
- **gdb** - *File Geodatabase* - A collection of files in a folder. Can store non-vector datatypes. 

### Server-based geodatabases: 

*Enterprise Geodatabases* - also known as multi-user geodatabses

ArcGIS acts as an application server, utilising storage in a database server: 

- DB2
- Oracle
- PostgreSQL
- SAP HANA
- SQL Server

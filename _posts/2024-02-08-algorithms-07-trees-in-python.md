Algorithms: Trees in Python 
=========================== 

Trees consist of a root and subtrees. 

* Parse trees can store mathematical expressions as a tree. 
* Binary trees have a maximum of two child nodes. 
* Binary Search Trees (BST) are defined as having a left branch holding lower values than the right branch. 

## Tree Traversal 

Pre-, In-, and Post-order traversals are classified by whether the root is visited first, betwen, or last among the sub-trees. 

_Pre-Order Traversal_: 
* visit root
* visit left subtree 
* visit right subtree

_ In-Order Traversal_: 
* visit left subtree 
* visit root
* visit right subtree

_ Post-Order Traversal_: 
* visit left subtree 
* visit right subtree
* visit root
